# Electronics and Circuits Labs!

This page will be regularly updated with a variety of different electronics and circuits labs that I have completed. Currently, most of these have been completed as a part of my Electronics and Circuits class (6.2000). Enjoy!

Update 1: Because I am a student with a lot of work, I'll currently leave a list of the different project labs that will be (eventually) included on this page once I have a semblance of free time.

1. Gamepad Controller (Soldering, Oscilloscope)
2. Digital-to-Analog Converter (Oscilloscope, Equivalent Resistances)
3. MOSFET Audio Amplifier (Oscilloscope, Equivalent Resistances, MOSFETs)

And more are planned out including: capacitive touch sensor, motor controller, light-following robots, etc.
