# Light-Tracking, Line-Following Robot Car

I made this project as a part of BlueStamp Engineering! By this point, I was comfortable enough with Arduinos and motor controllers that I really just wanted to play around with sensors and see what was possible, adding whatever new features came to mind in the moment. I had a lot of fun!

I documented my work through GitHub, which you can view at this link: [https://eden-hen.github.io/EdenH_Solar_Powered_Line-Following_Light-Tracking_Robot/](https://eden-hen.github.io/EdenH_Solar_Powered_Line-Following_Light-Tracking_Robot/).
