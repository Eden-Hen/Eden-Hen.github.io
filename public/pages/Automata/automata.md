# Flower Automata

Over winter break, I worked on creating an automata in order to get comfortable with the rapid-prototyping process and experiment with what I could make through simple wooden mechanisms.

Of course, it started with some brainstorming and preliminary tests:

I used cardboard at first in order to try and ensure that the mechanism itself would work:

But considering a significant part of my design revolved around the petals, which would be made by cutting into wood to make it flexible, I soon started prototyping directly with wood.

Finally, I had a working wooden prototype!

All that was left was to secure everything more safely in place, and then the flower automata would be complete!
