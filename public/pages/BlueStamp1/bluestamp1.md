# Gesture-Controlled Robot Car

I made this project as a part of BlueStamp Engineering! This was my first real introduction to engineering, and it's arguably what kicked off my love for robotics in the first place.

The website that hosted the documentation for this project is currently a bit broken (you may notice that certain spots for images/videos are left blank), but it still gives a good sense of my work. You can see what my younger self was up to at this link: [https://projects.bluestampengineering.com/student-projects/eden-h/](https://projects.bluestampengineering.com/student-projects/eden-h/).
