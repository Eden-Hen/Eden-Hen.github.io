# Old Website

Just like this website, I coded my original website from scratch!

The code is way less polished on the backend (in other words, it's an extreme mess), but making the website taught me a lot about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML (and just website development in general).

Also, I had a lot of fun with it. Feel free to take a look and play around with all of the features that I added!

(I went a little crazy with the hover effects, often to the detriment of the overall functionality of the website :))
